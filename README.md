## Project Description
This project was completed to fulfil the senior thesis requirement at Claremont McKenna College spring 2023, done under the supervision of Dr. Mike Izbicki

This project is a Python program designed to generate a senior thesis on a user-inputted topic using natural language processing techniques. The program takes in a topic from the user and then uses OpenAI API to deploy text models for text generation and evaluation, such as GPT-3 and Davincvi-003. The resulting output is in .tex format and includes a first-draft outline and paper, followed by slf-generated assesment, with scoring, revisions, and feedback comments instructing mannual revisions.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for students and researchers to quickly generate high-quality senior theses on a variety of topics, without having to spend months conducting research and writing. The intended audience for this program is undergraduate and graduate students in fields such as computer science, data science, and the social sciences.


The program is built using Python 3 and utiliizes OpenAI API for text generation and evaluation. It can be run on any operating system that supports Python, and installation instructions are provided further in the README.md file. OpenAI's API levarages the power of NLP and deep learning without having to implement all of the complex algorithms and techniques from scratch. Instead, you can use the API and model to handle tasks such as language generation, text classification, sentiment analysis, and more, which can save you time and effort.


The program is designed to be user-friendly and includes detailed documentation on how to use it, as well as a sample input and output file to demonstrate its functionality. The code is also well-commented and organized, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.

Overall, this project represents a novel approach to senior thesis writing that combines the power of natural language processing with the structure and rigor of academic research. By providing a tool that streamlines the research and writing process, we hope to enable more students to produce high-quality senior theses and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields.
